### 🌟 About Me

I recently completed a magical bioinformatics research co-op at Massachusetts General Hospital. There, I conjured insights from bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using my RShiny wand, I crafted interactive dashboards that brought complex biological data to life. My spells unraveled hidden mysteries within datasets, revealing the biological secrets they hold!

### 🪄 My Magical Powers

- **🧙‍♀️ Bioinformatics Wizardry**: Master of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing spells, multi-omics enchantments, and predictive modeling incantations to foresee biological outcomes.
- **🧠 Eternal Learner**: Always brewing new knowledge, currently diving into advanced machine learning for omics data integration and predictive modeling.
- **🤝 Collaboration Enthusiast**: Excited to team up on multi-omics adventures, RNA sequencing expeditions, or building interactive web tools that bring data to life!
- **☕ Fun Fact**: A strong cup of coffee and a thrilling mystery (from BookTok or Netflix) are my favorite companions for brainstorming new data spells!
- **🏙️ Current Location**: Boston is where I live... for now!
